# Project 3 Starter Code

 ## Introduction


 Welcome to our repository for WDI-27's group project! We have created an Angular app, Wabi Sabi, that functions as an e-commerce website that is setup with Stripe payments, ng-cart, custom order, user, and product schemas, and bootstrap.

 ### A short description


 Wabi Sabi is an app that allows users to login or register through our website or through instagram oauth. Users can edit their profile, post products to sell, receive orders from other users, and place orders themselves. We utilized Stripe for the payment system, ng-cart for storing items to be ordered and checking out, and we created custom order and product schemas for everything else.

 The app requires registration or logging in to access product and user content. Users can choose to login with Instagram or through our app. Additionally, once a user is verified they can post content and start placing orders.

 Posting products is easy. Users can upload images through amazon-web-services. Only the owner of a profile our product can edit or delete them..
